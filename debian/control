Description: WindowMaker dockapp to monitor memory and swap usage
 wmmemload displays the current memory and swap usage as a percentage
 value. It is based on wmcpuload and wmmemmon, and as such looks very
 nice alongside those.
 .
 wmmemload is designed to work with the WindowMaker dock, but will work with
 other window managers as well.
